The website was created using the **[Clever Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDV3Z1KCBvo&t=25454s)** channel tutorial.
This clone was created using React and Firebase hosting and development tools.
Other libraries were also used to assist in development, such as the Stripe API (for payments) among others.

For full operation it is necessary to fill in the corresponding API keys.
firebase.jsx -> Firebase Web API
App.jsx -> Stripe Public Key
Functions\index.js -> Stripe Secret Key

An active database is also required. To do this, you can deploy the database to a firebase project or just emulate a firebase database on the local host.
